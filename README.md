# Keep-on-Closing

Hello! I hope this message finds you well! After our last project predicting house prices was so successful, I thought we could work on a follow up project. Since the last time I have collected more data to improve the model to predict house prices. It was clear that I needed at least one other predictor, so I decided to start recording the style of architecture of each property. I specialize in three types of Architectures: Craftsman, Queen Anne, and Victorian. The new data that I collected is in the attached data file.

In our last project we verified how much the square footage of the house affects the price of the property, but I don't know how this relationship is affected when we take the architecture style into consideration. I would like to better understand how both the square footage and the style of the house affects the price so that I can better target specific homes to make the most profit on a sale. Can you help me to better understand how both of these variables affect the Price of these properties?
